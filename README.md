# OhMyFiles

OhMyFiles is a school project at the University of St. Gallen. This application is designed to synchronize files securely via SSH + rsync so you always have a backup of your important files.


## Goal

The goal of this project is to make use of one of the safest file transfer mechanisms (SSH + rsync) to instantly backup files from your computer. The inspiration came from being dependent on third party applications (like Google Cloud, DropBox or even self-hosted applications like ownCloud). When using a cloud provider, you give up control of your files. When using a self-hosted solution, you need to take care of updating the application, otherwise your solution will end up having security holes.

### Prerequisites

What you will need before starting:

* rsync installed on your computer
* If you do not want to use the binaries but rather want to run it with node, **node v.13.2**
* a remote server with SSH installed and access to it via ssh key
